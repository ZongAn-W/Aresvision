# Uploaded Model Training

Trusted lab users can upload a single Python file from the model training page and train it with the platform datasets.

The platform owns data loading, normalization, batching, the training loop, metrics, checkpoints, logs, and model testing. The uploaded file only defines the PyTorch architecture and a small parameter schema.

## Downloading and Renaming Uploaded Models

On the training page, expand **Manage models**, select a model, and choose
**Download source** or **Rename**. Renaming accepts a nonempty display name of
up to 120 characters, trims surrounding whitespace, and updates that package's
name in the list and current model summary. Save commits the change; Cancel or
Escape closes the editor. Revalidation preserves the edited name.

Both actions require authentication and are available only to the uploader:

| Action | API | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Download source | `GET /api/user-models/{model_id}/download` | Original uploaded bytes as a `.py` attachment, retaining the original basename |
| Rename | `PATCH /api/user-models/{model_id}` with `{"display_name":"New name"}` | Updated model metadata |

Other accounts receive 403; nonexistent or deleted packages receive 404.
Downloads also return 404 when the stored source is missing. Invalid names are
rejected with 400 or 422. Invalid or pending models may still be renamed or
downloaded so their source can be repaired locally.

Renaming changes metadata only: the package ID, version, source, content hash,
validation result, and model identity already fixed in training tasks remain
unchanged. The name inside `MODEL_SPEC` is not rewritten, and re-uploading the
downloaded file follows the normal upload/version rules. Matching display names
do not merge packages. Downloads contain architecture source; trained weights
remain available from training task artifacts.

## Required Exports

Every upload must export:

- `MODEL_SPEC`: metadata and adjustable parameters.
- `build_model(config)`: a callable that returns a `torch.nn.Module`.
- One or more `torch.nn.Module` classes used by `build_model`.

Use [uploaded-model-template.py](uploaded-model-template.py) as the starting point.

## Tensor Contract

The model receives tensors with this shape:

```text
[batch, window, channels, height, width]
```

It must return predictions with this shape:

```text
[batch, horizon, 1, height, width]
```

The platform passes these core config keys to `build_model(config)`:

- `in_channels`
- `window`
- `horizon`
- `height`
- `width`
- `selected_channels`

Any custom fields declared in `MODEL_SPEC["parameters"]` are also included in `config`.

## Mars Input Channels and Checkpoints

For Mars, `selected_channels` contains only user-selected auxiliary inputs, such as
`["U", "D"]`. O3 is the fixed prediction target and the first input channel. The
complete model input order is `["O3", *selected_channels]`: selecting no auxiliaries
still supplies one O3 channel, and selecting U supplies `["O3", "U"]`.

Both the official `demo3.py` runner and uploaded `user_model_runner.py` runner save
the shared `aresvision_mars_forecast_checkpoint_v1` contract. The checkpoint retains
auxiliary-only `training_contract.selected_channels`, while
`normalization.input_channel_order` records the complete order. `input_mean`,
`input_scale`, and `constant_channel_mask` each have one entry per input channel;
each mean/scale entry has the training grid shape. Loading rejects reordered or
missing channel names, incorrect counts or shapes, non-finite statistics, and
non-positive input scales. Providing invalid saved normalization never silently
refits it.

Inference applies input statistics in that exact order, and independently uses
`target_mean` and `target_scale` to restore predicted O3 values (with the existing
`1e-6` scale epsilon). A constant target can retain `target_scale=0`; input scales
must remain positive. Scaled-volume caches include checkpoint statistics so two
tasks with the same data and channels cannot reuse each other's normalization.

Older versioned checkpoints that recorded only auxiliary channel names are
rejected. Retrain them, or migrate them separately only after verifying the
original tensor order and all statistics; there is no automatic metadata repair.
Legacy bare `state_dict` weights retain the existing normalization-refit path.
These conventions apply to Mars; the Earth contract remains independent.

Mars checkpoints also bind the initial training data identity. `mcd_overview`
records the original full MCD directory; `openmars_mcd` records both OpenMARS and
MCD directories, with source-tagged manifests. The runner retains the initial
statistics and file identity instead of reloading them after training. Both
prediction paths verify the saved directories, file names, sizes and modification
times before cache/window/model access. A changed source returns HTTP 409
`dataset_version_changed` and requires retraining. Complete identities are marked
`verified`; historical weights without file identity stay explicitly `legacy`.
Incomplete versioned checkpoints are rejected. See the
[Mars dataset identity contract](dataset-registry.md#mars-数据绑定与预测校验).

## Declaring Which Dataset Feeds a Model

By default an uploaded model is **Mars-only**. To train it on Earth MERRA-2 data it must
opt in explicitly:

```python
MODEL_SPEC = {
    "name": "EarthConvBaseline",
    "datasets": {
        "earth_merra2": {
            "grid": [[36, 72]],
            "window": [7],
            "horizon": [3],
            "auxiliary_inputs": [],
            "target_leading_channels": 1,
        }
    },
    "parameters": {"hidden_dim": {"type": "int", "default": 16, "min": 4, "max": 64}},
}
```

Being valid for Mars is **not** enough for Earth. A model is accepted for Earth training
only when all of these hold:

1. the source file is present and hashes to the recorded digest;
2. it passes the shared safety gate (imports limited to `torch` / `numpy`, no
   `open` / `eval` / `exec` / `compile` / `__import__`, no `system` / `popen` / `Popen` / `run`);
3. `MODEL_SPEC["datasets"]` declares the `earth_merra2` feed;
4. that declaration does not require Ls or MOLA topography — Earth training rejects
   Mars-only auxiliary inputs;
5. a real dry-run builds the model with Earth's window/horizon/grid and runs
   `[1, 7, {1, 5}, 36, 72]` → `[1, 3, 1, 36, 72]`.

Any failure is reported with a reason; the training page disables "start experiment"
until the verdict is positive. An upload with no `datasets` block keeps its historical
Mars behaviour and reports `"compatible": false` for Earth with the reason
`MODEL_SPEC does not declare the earth_merra2 dataset feed`.

The Earth feed does **not** pass `ls` or MOLA topography, so anything a model needs must
come from the five Earth channels (`TO3` plus four optional). `selected_channels` for
Earth starts with the mandatory `TO3` target.

Ask the server for the verdict instead of guessing:

```text
GET /api/user-models/{model_id}/earth-compatibility
```

```json
{
  "package_id": "…", "display_name": "EarthConvBaseline", "version": 3,
  "validation_status": "valid", "source_available": true,
  "compatible": true, "reasons": [], "warnings": [],
  "datasets": {"earth_merra2": {"grid": [[36, 72]], "window": [7], "horizon": [3]}},
  "output_shape": [1, 3, 1, 36, 72]
}
```

The same verdict is embedded in every upload / revalidate response as
`validation_report.earth` (with `validation_report.datasets`), so it also appears in
`GET /api/user-models`.

## Training on Earth With an Uploaded Model

Start the task with `model_source=uploaded` and a top-level `uploaded_model_id`;
validated parameter values go under `hyperparameters.custom_model_params`:

```json
{
  "model_script": "unified_training.py",
  "model_name": "Earth uploaded conv",
  "model_source": "uploaded",
  "uploaded_model_id": "<UserModelPackage.id>",
  "dataset_id": "earth_merra2_daily_v2",
  "hyperparameters": {
    "training_dataset": "earth_merra2_daily_v2",
    "model_source": "uploaded",
    "selected_channels": ["U10M", "T2M"],
    "epochs": 5,
    "custom_model_params": {"hidden_dim": 16, "dropout": 0.0}
  }
}
```

The server pins the package id, version, content hash, validated parameter values and the
hash-verified source text at task creation:

- uploading a newer version later does **not** change what this task trains;
- the checkpoint embeds the verified source, so the model is rebuilt and predicted after a
  service restart, and still works if the original file is deleted or tampered with;
- no pickle/unserialize of user objects happens anywhere: the embedded text is re-checked
  by the same AST gate and `build_model(config)` is called; weights load with
  `torch.load(..., weights_only=True)`;
- when the original file is missing or changed, prediction succeeds from the embedded copy
  and says so in the response `warnings` field and the prediction page.

Parameter values are checked against the uploaded package's own
`MODEL_SPEC["parameters"]` schema (type, `min`/`max`, `select` options, unknown keys). A
model that reads a declared parameter still builds even if the stored schema is incomplete,
because the declaration's defaults are used as a fallback.

## Optional Ls Input

Models that use historical solar longitude can opt into a separate `ls` tensor. The declaration must exactly match this contract:

```python
MODEL_SPEC = {
    "name": "ExamplePhaseModel",
    "description": "Model with explicit solar-longitude context.",
    "auxiliary_inputs": {
        "ls": {
            "required": True,
            "shape": ["batch", "window"],
            "dtype": "float32",
            "unit": "degree",
        }
    },
    "parameters": {},
}
```

The model then accepts two inputs:

```python
def forward(self, x, ls):
    # x:  [batch, window, channels, height, width]
    # ls: [batch, window]
    ...
```

Each Ls value is measured in degrees and corresponds to the historical frame at the same window index. Ls always covers the input window, even when `window` and `horizon` differ.

Models that omit `auxiliary_inputs` remain single-input models and receive only `model(x)`. The platform does not inspect the function signature, insert Ls into a feature channel, or retry calls after `TypeError`.

For declared Ls models, the platform rejects missing data, non-floating tensors, values with the wrong `[batch, window]` shape, and any `NaN` or infinite value. It never substitutes zeros, random values, or `None` for required Ls data. Unknown auxiliary inputs and deviations from the metadata block above are rejected during upload validation.

## Optional MOLA Topography Input

Models can opt into static Mars surface elevation independently of Ls:

```python
MODEL_SPEC = {
    "name": "ExampleTopographyModel",
    "description": "Model with explicit MOLA terrain context.",
    "auxiliary_inputs": {
        "topography": {
            "required": True,
            "shape": ["batch", 1, "height", "width"],
            "dtype": "float32",
            "unit": "meter",
        }
    },
    "parameters": {},
}
```

The corresponding method is:

```python
def forward(self, x, topography):
    # x:           [batch, window, channels, height, width]
    # topography:  [batch, 1, height, width], float32 meters
    ...
```

Topography is static. It has no window dimension, is not repeated through time,
and is not included in `in_channels`. The platform reads the actual latitude
and longitude coordinates of the selected training dataset and periodically
resamples its built-in NASA/PDS MOLA grid to those coordinates. Matching array
dimensions alone are not treated as spatial alignment.

A model can declare both auxiliary inputs:

```python
MODEL_SPEC = {
    "name": "ExampleLsTopographyModel",
    "auxiliary_inputs": {
        "ls": {
            "required": True,
            "shape": ["batch", "window"],
            "dtype": "float32",
            "unit": "degree",
        },
        "topography": {
            "required": True,
            "shape": ["batch", 1, "height", "width"],
            "dtype": "float32",
            "unit": "meter",
        },
    },
    "parameters": {},
}

def forward(self, x, ls, topography):
    ...
```

Dispatch is based only on `MODEL_SPEC` and always uses this order: `x`, then
declared `ls`, then declared `topography`. The platform does not inspect the
function signature, catch `TypeError` to retry, or pass undeclared inputs.

Upload dry-run, training, validation, final metrics, test evaluation,
permutation importance, and formal prediction all use the same dispatcher.
Permutation importance shuffles only ordinary `x` features; Ls and topography
remain fixed. The static `[1, height, width]` terrain tensor is expanded to
`[batch, 1, height, width]` without copying it for each sample.

A declared topography model fails clearly if the MOLA asset is absent, corrupt,
non-finite, or cannot align to the target coordinates. There is no zero, random,
`None`, or flat-terrain fallback. Models without a topography declaration do
not load the asset. See [mola-topography-asset.md](mola-topography-asset.md) for
the source product and reproduction process.

## Parameter Schema

Supported parameter types:

- `int`: requires `default`, `min`, and `max`.
- `float`: requires `default`, `min`, and `max`.
- `bool`: requires `default`.
- `select`: requires string `default` and non-empty string `options`.

Example:

```python
MODEL_SPEC = {
    "name": "ExampleUploadedModel",
    "description": "Small convolutional baseline.",
    "parameters": {
        "hidden_dim": {"type": "int", "default": 16, "min": 4, "max": 128},
        "dropout": {"type": "float", "default": 0.1, "min": 0.0, "max": 0.9},
        "use_bias": {"type": "bool", "default": True},
        "activation": {"type": "select", "default": "relu", "options": ["relu", "gelu"]},
    },
}
```

## Validation Rules

Version 1 accepts these import roots:

- `torch`
- `numpy`

The validator rejects filesystem, subprocess, dynamic execution, and network-style escape hatches such as `open`, `eval`, `exec`, `compile`, `__import__`, `system`, `popen`, `Popen`, and `run`.

Before a model can be trained, the platform:

1. Parses the file as UTF-8 Python.
2. Checks imports and disallowed calls.
3. Imports the module in a validation process.
4. Normalizes `MODEL_SPEC["parameters"]`, optional `MODEL_SPEC["datasets"]` and optional auxiliary-input metadata.
5. Calls `build_model(config)`.
6. Runs a Mars dry forward pass with x shape `[2, 3, 1, 8, 16]` and, when declared, Ls shape `[2, 3]`, requiring output shape `[2, 3, 1, 8, 16]`.
7. When the model declares `earth_merra2`, additionally builds it for Earth and runs `[1, 7, C, 36, 72]` → `[1, 3, 1, 36, 72]` for `C` in `{1, 5}`, recording the result as `validation_report.earth`.

Step 7 runs the same AST safety gate as steps 1–2. An uploaded model that fails it is
still uploadable as a Mars model; it simply never becomes Earth-capable.

## Minimal Model

```python
from torch import nn


MODEL_SPEC = {
    "name": "RepeatLastFrame",
    "parameters": {},
}


class RepeatLastFrame(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, horizon):
        super().__init__()
        self.horizon = horizon

    def forward(self, x):
        last_frame = x[:, -1, :1]
        return last_frame.unsqueeze(1).repeat(1, self.horizon, 1, 1, 1)


def build_model(config):
    return RepeatLastFrame(config["horizon"])
```
