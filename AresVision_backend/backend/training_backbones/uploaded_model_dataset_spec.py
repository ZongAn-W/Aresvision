"""Optional dataset-capability declaration for uploaded user models.

Uploaded models are single ``.py`` files exporting ``MODEL_SPEC`` and
``build_model(config)``. Historically a spec only described its parameter schema
and (optionally) Mars auxiliary inputs, and every accepted model was assumed to
be usable for Mars data. That implicit assumption is wrong for Earth: an Earth
sample is a different tensor shape on a different grid with no Ls and no MOLA
topography, so "works on Mars" must never be read as "works on Earth".

This module adds an **optional** ``MODEL_SPEC.datasets`` block:

.. code-block:: python

    MODEL_SPEC = {
        "name": "MyEarthModel",
        "parameters": {...},
        "datasets": {
            "earth_merra2": {
                # heights/widths the model accepts; absent means "any"
                "grid": [[36, 72]],
                "window": [7],
                "horizon": [3],
                # auxiliary inputs the model needs *in addition* to x; the Earth
                # feed provides none, so any declared input makes it incompatible.
                "auxiliary_inputs": [],
                # optional: declare how many leading input channels must be TO3
                "target_leading_channels": 1,
            }
        },
    }

Backward compatibility rules:

* No ``datasets`` block -> the spec keeps the historical meaning: usable for
  Mars, and **not** usable for Earth.
* ``datasets`` present but without an Earth feed -> not usable for Earth.
* ``datasets`` present -> the spec must still describe every dataset it claims
  consistently, so a malformed block is a validation error rather than a silent
  downgrade.
